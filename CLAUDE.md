## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Pre-Commit Testing Requirements
**EVERY developer MUST execute E2E tests with MCP before committing code:**

1. **Identify Affected Tests**:
   ```bash
   npm run e2e:affected
   ```

2. **Run Complete Test Suite** (if major changes):
   ```bash
   npm run docker:test  # Start test environment
   npm run e2e          # Run all tests
   ```

3. **Verify All Tests Pass** before proceeding with commit

4. **Commit Only After** successful test execution

### Test Execution Responsibility
- **Individual Developer**: Must run affected E2E tests before every commit
- **No Automated Hooks**: Manual execution ensures developer awareness of test results
- **MCP Integration**: Test data is automatically managed through MCP server
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Authentication, navigation, courses, and user management flows

The E2E test suite provides comprehensive coverage of all major user flows, ensuring reliability and quality of the LMS system through mandatory manual testing before every commit.
